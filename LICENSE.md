Defer your questions about the license to the relevant sites, but here are my general thoughts:

* This software is free and open source.
* The software was written for the ATLAS TileCal Collaboration at CERN to support the Tile Demonstrator and Prometeo projects.
* If you are using this software for learning and teaching purposes, you are doing it exactly right. Send me an email.
* If it is used for work that is shared or presented to others, give proper credit.
* If you modify it, give proper credit and share under a similar license with the same philosophy.
* If you use it as derivation (whole or part) to other software, give me proper credit and share under a similar license with the same philosophy.
* Profitting from the use of or access to this software is not OK.

TL;DR -- Feel free to use this software for education, but do not take away my credit for what it does for you.
